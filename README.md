## How does it work?
FreeTube uses a built in extractor to grab and serve data / videos. The [Invidious API](https://github.com/iv-org/invidious) can also optionally be used. FreeTube does not use any official APIs to obtain data. While YouTube can still see your video requests, it can no
longer track you using cookies or JavaScript. Your subscriptions, playlists and history are stored locally on your computer and never sent out.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> Using a VPN or Tor is highly recommended to hide your IP while using FreeTube.

## Features
* Watch videos without ads
* Use YouTube without Google tracking you using cookies and JavaScript
* Two extractor APIs to choose from (Built in or Invidious)
* Subscribe to channels without an account
* Connect to an externally setup proxy such as Tor
* View and search your local subscriptions, playlists and history
* Organize your subscriptions into "Profiles" to create a more focused feed
* Export & import subscriptions
* YouTube Trending
* YouTube Chapters
* Most popular videos page based on the set Invidious instance
* SponsorBlock
* DeArrow
* Open videos from your browser directly into FreeTube (with extension)
* Watch videos using an external player
* Full Theme support
* Make a screenshot of a video
* Multiple windows
* Mini Player (Picture-in-Picture)
* Keyboard shortcuts
* Option to show only family friendly content
* Show/hide functionality or elements within the app using the distraction free settings
* View channel posts

### Browser Extensions
The following extensions open YouTube links directly in FreeTube:

- [LibRedirect](https://libredirect.manerakai.com/)
- [RedirectTube](https://github.com/MStankiewiczOfficial/RedirectTube)

LibRedirect automatically redirect YouTube links to FreeTube.
> [!IMPORTANT]
> To ensure proper functionality, select FreeTube as Frontend in the Services settings of the extension.

RedirectTube, doesn’t automatically open YouTube links in FreeTube (although this feature can be enabled in the settings). Instead, it adds buttons to the toolbar and context menu, which you can click to open videos in FreeTube manually.

- Download LibRedirect from [Mozilla Add-ons](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/libredirect/) (for Firefox based-browsers) or [developer's website](https://libredirect.manerakai.com/download_chromium.html) (for Chrome and Chromium-based browsers).

- Download RedirectTube from [Mozilla Add-ons](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/redirecttube/) (for Firefox based-browsers) or [Chrome Web Store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/redirecttube/jpbaggklodpddjcadlebabhiopjkjfjh) (for Chrome and Chromium-based browsers).

> [!NOTE]
> These extensions do not work on Linux portable builds!
>
> If you have issues with the extension working with FreeTube, please create an issue in this project instead of the extension project.

## Contributing

*Excerpt from upstream `CONTRIBUTING.md`:*

# Code Contributions

## Before starting to code
 Please follow these guidelines before starting to code you feature or bugfix.
 * If you want to implement a bugfix or feature request from an existing issue, please comment on that issue that you will work on it. This helps us to coordinate what needs to be done and what not.
 * If you want to implement a feature request without an existing issue, please create an issue, so we know what you are working on and discuss the feature.
 * For major feature implementations make sure you are able to maintain your code in the future in regard to bugs and possible code conflicts in future updates. Optionally you could join the [Matrix](https://matrix.to/#/#freetubeapp:matrix.org) channel, so you will hear instantly if something needs to be worked on. 
 * Do not open pull requests that are primarily written by AI. It's a waste of our team's time. Repeat offenders will be banned.

## Before your Pull Request
Please follow these guidelines before sending your pull request and making contributions.
* When you submit a pull request, you agree that your code is published under the [GNU Affero General Public License](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl-3.0.html)
* Please link the issue you are referring to.
* Do not include non-free software or modules with your code.
* Make sure your pull request is set up to merge your branch to FreeTube's development branch.
* Make sure your branch is up to date with the development branch before submitting your pull request.
* Stick to a similar style of code already in the project.  Please look at current code to get an idea on how to do this.
* Follow [ES6](https://rse.github.io/es6-features/) standards in your code. Ex: Use `let` and `const` instead of `var`. Do not use `function(response){//code}` for callbacks, use `(response) => {//code}`.
* Comment your code when necessary.  Follow the [JavaScript Documentation and Comments Standard](https://www.drupal.org/docs/develop/standards/javascript/javascript-api-documentation-and-comment-standards) for functions.
* Please follow proper Vue structure when creating new code / components.  Use existing code as well as the [Vue.js Guide](https://vuejs.org/guide/introduction.html) for reference.
* Please test your code.  Make sure new features work as well as existing core features such as watching videos or loading subscriptions.  New features need to work with both the Local API as well as the Invidious API
* Please make sure your code does n
